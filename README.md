This programme randomly generates data for a probability density function (PDF) representing a radioactive decay
using box method and plots a histogram of the whole distribution or just its components. It also performs
a maximum likelihood fit on the PDF parameters for the complete data set with both time and angle data
and its partial version with time data only available. In addition, it calculates simple and proper errors
for the best-fit values and plots NLL (the negative of the log of the joint likelihood) against a parameter.
